# Movies-Point
This app is completely built using React JS. In this application, we can search for various movies 
and get multiple results. By clicking on any movie, we get detailed information about that movie, 
and we can add that movie to our watch list. In the watch list summary, we get a detailed summary 
like how much watch time is required to watch all movies present in the watch list, the total number 
of movies in the watch list, etc. Movie data is fetched from a third-party library, OMDB, and watch 
list data is stored in browser local storage, so users can see their stored data whenever they return 
to the website.
